# SentimentAnalysisUsingBERT
Build a sentiment classification model using BERT from the Transformers library by Hugging Face with PyTorch and Python.

## Goal
Intuitively understand what BERT is
Preprocess text data for BERT and build PyTorch Dataset (tokenization, attention masks, and padding)
Use Transfer Learning to build Sentiment Classifier using the Transformers library by Hugging Face
Evaluate the model on test data
Predict sentiment on raw text

Learn more about what BERT is, how to use it, and fine-tune it for sentiment analysis on Google Play app reviews. How good will your model be?

## Data Description
You are provided with a large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. 
The types of toxicity are:
toxic
severe_toxic
obscene
threat
insult
identity_hate
You must create a model which predicts a probability of each type of toxicity for each comment.

(​)  Create a Sentiment Classifier using Transfer Learning and BERT
(​)  Training the model
(​)  Evaluation  - how good our model is?
(​)  Predicting sentiment from raw text
