# SentimentAnalysisUsingBERT
Build a sentiment classification model using BERT from the Transformers library by Hugging Face with PyTorch and Python.

## Goal
Intuitively understand what BERT is
Preprocess text data for BERT and build PyTorch Dataset (tokenization, attention masks, and padding)
Use Transfer Learning to build Sentiment Classifier using the Transformers library by Hugging Face
Evaluate the model on test data
Predict sentiment on raw text

Learn more about what BERT is, how to use it, and fine-tune it for sentiment analysis on Google Play app reviews. How good will your model be?

## Tasks
 What is BERT?
(​)  Notebook progress review
(​)  Load BERT using Hugging Face
(​)  Create a Sentiment Classifier using Transfer Learning and BERT
(​)  Training the model
(​)  Evaluation  - how good our model is?
(​)  Predicting sentiment from raw text
